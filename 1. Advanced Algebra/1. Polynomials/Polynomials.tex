\maketitle

This chapter is the 1st one of the course \textbf{Adavanced Algebra}, which is about the polynomials. Here it is necessary to claim a ``definition (Df) -> theorem (Th)'' working cycle, which acts as the writing style throughout this whole course. This working cycle is shown bellow:

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{2pt}
\begin{Df}{Some Definition}
    The text of this definition.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    The text of the remarks about the definition just proposed (possibly including what it means and what it is for).\\
    \textcolor{Df}{Some remarks with some incidental definitions.}\\
    \textcolor{Th}{Some remarks with some incidental theorems.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Some Theorem}
    The text of this theorem.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: The proof of this theorem (is possibly "todo" when the author cannot complete it yet).
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    The text of the remarks about the definition just proposed (possibly including what it means and what it is for).\\
    \textcolor{Df}{Some remarks with some incidental definitions.}\\
    \textcolor{Th}{Some remarks with some incidental theorems.}
\end{Rmk}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{2pt}
As for the text of both a definition or a theorem, a common fixed pattern of sentences is adopted, which is ``Suppose \dots (some pre-conditions or background information). Then \dots (the direct text for the definition or the theorem).''. Please identify this pattern later by yourself. 

By the way, we now pre-claim some commonly-used notations:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item $\mathbb{C}$: the set of the complex numbers;
    \item $\mathbb{R}$: the set of the real numbers;
    \item $\mathbb{Q}$: the set of the rational numbers;
    \item $\mathbb{Z}$: the set of the integers;
    \item $\mathbb{N}$: the set of the natural numbers;
    \item $\mathbb{N^\ast}$: the set of the positive integers.
\end{compactenum} 
Then with everything prepared, here we go.

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.1 (number field (数域))}
    Suppose $\mathbb{F}\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ and $0,1\in\mathbb{F}$. Then $\mathbb{F}$ is called a number field if:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\forall (a,b\in \mathbb{F}), (a+b, a-b, a\cdot b \in \mathbb{F})$;
        \item $\forall (a,b\in \mathbb{F} \text{ and } b\neq 0), (a/b\in \mathbb{F})$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    In other word, a subset $\mathbb{F}$ of $\mathbb{C}$ that contains 0 and 1 is called a number field if it is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (the divider is non-zero).\\
    \textcolor{Th}{For example, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are number field, while $\mathbb{Z}$ is not.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.1.1 ($\mathbb{Q}$ is the minimal number field)}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\mathbb{Q}$ is a number field;
        \item For any number field $\mathbb{F}$, $\mathbb{F}\supseteq\mathbb{Q}$.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Since any number field $\mathbb{F}$ contains 0 and 1, it contains all integers due to the closure of addition and subtraction; and it further contains all fractions due to the closure of division.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.2 (polynomial)}
    Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is a number field and $\pmb{a} = \{a_n: n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is a sequence of numbers in $\mathbb{F}$ such that
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $a_n = 0$ for all negative $n$;
        \item There are finitely many $a_n$'s that are non-zero.
    \end{compactenum}
    Suppose also $x$ is a charactor. Then the tuple $(\pmb{a}, x)$ is called a \textbf{polynomial} about $x$ in $\mathbb{F}$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item This definition of polynomial is an abstraction of the polynomials we learnt before. What we learnt is that a polynomial is a function about $x$ of the form $f(x) = a_nx^n+\dots+a_1x+a_0$, where $x$ is engaged in some operations of addition, multiplication and power and we can see that such a polynomial is determined by a sequence of numbers $(a_0, \dots, a_n)$. The definition here generalizes the concept of addition, multiplication and power, and is regardless of what $x$ is. Instead, it is just a tuple $(\pmb{a}, x)$ and can be denoted in a function-like way $f(x)$ where $f$ wraps the information of the coefficients $\pmb{a}$ and $x$ tells us what the polynomial is about. Actually we make this abstraction aimed at explore the common properties of polynomials.
        \item To link this kind of general polynomial to the one we learnt before, we first try to write it as the form $f(x) = a_nx^n + \dots + a_1x + a_0$, which requires the specification of the addition and multiplication for polynomials. \textcolor{Df}{For any two polynomials $f(x) = (\pmb{a}, x)$ and $g(x) = (\pmb{b}, x)$ about $x$ in $\mathbb{F}$, we define the addition and multiplication of them as:
        \begin{compactitem}
            \item $f(x)+g(x) = (\pmb{a}+\pmb{b}, x)$;
            \item $f(x)\cdot g(x) = (\{c_n: n\in\mathbb{Z}\}, x)$ where $c_n = \sum_{i+j = n} a_ib_j$.
        \end{compactitem}}
        And we can see that this definition of addition and multiplication is consistent with the one we learnt before. \textcolor{Th}{Now if for a sequence $\{a_n\}$ that has only one non-zero element $a_i$, we denote the polynomial $(\{a_n\}, x)$ by $a_ix^i$, we can see that any polynomial $f(x) = (\{a_n\}, x)$ where $n$ is an integer such that $a_N=0$ for all $N>n$, can be written as $f(x) = a_nx^n + \dots + a_0x^0$ or $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_ix^i$} \textcolor{Df}{Here we define the largest $n$ such that $a_n\neq 0$ (if there are any non-zero elements in $\{a_n$\}) as the degree of $f(x)$, denoted by $\deg f(x) = n$; if all elements of $\{a_n\}$ is $0$, we call $f(x)$ the zero polynomial, whose degree is defined as $\deg f(x) = -\infty$.}
        \item For a polynomial $f(x) = (\{a_n\}, x)$, the sequence of numbers $\{a_n\}$ is called the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $a_k$ is called the $k$-th coefficient.
        \item \textcolor{Df}{In convention, we write $a_0x^0$ as $a_0$ as if $x^0 = 1$. Although inaccurate since $0^0$ is meaningless, this handling shows its convenience in algebra.}
        \item From the definition of polynomial addition and multiplication, we should clearly understand that \textcolor{Th}{any number field $\mathbb{F}$ makes the collection of all polynomials in it closed under polynomial addition, subtraction and multiplication.}
        \item And we can easily verify \textcolor{Th}{the commutativity, associativity of both addition and multiplication among polynomials, along with the distributive law of multiplication over addition.}
        \item By simple subtraction, we can also easily prove the cancellation of multiplication:\\
        \textcolor{Th}{Suppose $f(x)$, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are all polynomials in $\mathbb{F}$, and $h(x)\neq 0$. Then $h(x)f(x) = h(x)g(x)$ implies $f(x) = g(x)$.}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.2.1 (the degree of polynomial sum and product)}
    Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials in $\mathbb{F}$. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\deg(f(x)\pm g(x))\leq \max(\deg f(x), \deg g(x))$;
        \item $\deg(f(x)g(x)) = \deg f(x)+\deg g(x)$.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    Obviously this theorem still holds for the case of arbitrarily finitely many polynomials.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{$\circ$ Df1.3 (unary (一元的) polynomial ring on $\mathbb{F}$)}
    Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is a number field and $x$ is a charactor. Then the collection of all polynomials about $x$ in $\mathbb{F}$ is called a unary polynomial ring on $\mathbb{F}$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. And we denote a polynomial $f(x)$ in this ring by $f(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    This definition is something involving the group theory we will learn in the future. Now let us just treat it as a pre-condition when we discuss the polynomials.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.4 (division with remainder in $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$)}
    Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is a number field. Then for any polynomials $f(x), g(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ such that $g(x)\neq 0$, there exist unique $q(x), r(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ s.t. 
    $$f(x) = q(x)g(x)+r(x) \text{ and } \deg r(x)<\deg g(x)$$
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: \begin{compactenum}
        \item[(I)] Existence: for any such given $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can apply the polynomial division algorithm (please search online by yourself), and then yield the quotient $q(x)$ and the remainder $r(x)$ with $\deg r(x)<\deg g(x)$.
        \item[(II)] Uniqueness: we can first assume that $f(x) = 0$ and prove that $q(x) = r(x) = 0$. Then we assume that there are $g_1(x), r_1(x)$ and $g_2(x), r_2(x)$ satisfying the condition, and obtain that $q(x)[g_1(x)-g_2(x)]+[r_1(x)-r_2(x)] = 0$, namely, $g_1(x) = g_2(x)$, $r_1(x) = r_2(x)$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    The division with remainder here is similar to the one of integers. \textcolor{Df}{Here $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ are again called the quotient and the remainder respectively.} And we will see that the exact division theory of polynomials (talked later) can be found on the same logic with that in the number theory.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.5 (exact division (整除))}
    Suppose $f(x), g(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. Then we say $g(x)$ exactly divides $f(x)$ (or $g(x)$ divides $f(x)$, or $f(x)$ is divisible by $g(x)$) if:
    $$\exists h(x) \text{ s.t. } f(x) = h(x)g(x).$$
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Df}{``$g(x)$ exactly divides $f(x)$'' is denoted by ``$g(x)\mid f(x)$'', and ``$g(x)$ does not exactly divides $f(x)$'' is by ``$g(x)\nmid f(x)$''. If $g(x)\mid f(x)$, then $g(x)$ is called a factor of $f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is called a multiple of $g(x)$.} Note that the definition of exact division does not force $g(x)$ to be non-zero.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.5.1}
    Suppose $f(x), g(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ and $g(x)\neq 0$. Then:\\
    $g(x)$ exactly divides $f(x)$ iff the remainder of $f(x)$ divided by $g(x)$ is $0$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    From the definition of exact division, we can see that: \textcolor{Th}{
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Any polynomial divides itself;
        \item Any polynomial divides $0$;
        \item Any 0-degree polynomial divides any polynomial.
    \end{compactenum}}
    When $g(x)\mid f(x)$, \textcolor{Df}{we can also denote the quotient of $f(x)$ divided by $g(x)$ by $f(x)/g(x)$ or $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.5.2 (some basic properties of exact division)}
    Suppose $f(x), g(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $f(x)\mid g(x)$ and $g(x)\mid f(x)$, then $f(x) = cg(x)$ for some non-zero number $c$ in $\mathbb{F}$;
        \item (Transitive:) If $h(x)\mid g(x)$ and $g(x)\mid f(x)$, then $h(x)\mid f(x)$;
        \item Suppose also $f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x), u_1(x), \dots, u_n(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ where $n$ is a positive integer. If $g(x)\mid f_i(x)$ for $i=1,\dots,n$, then $g(x)\mid\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i(x)f_i(x)$.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Df}{About the 3rd term of the theorem above, we called $\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i(x)f_i(x)$ a combination of the polynomials $f_1(x),\dots, f_n(x)$.}
    \textcolor{Th}{Also from the above theorem, we can see that: if $f(x) = cg(x)$ for some non-zero number $c\in\mathbb{F}$, then $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ share the common factors and have the common multiples. In other word, $f(x) = cg(x)$ indicates that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are identical in the sense of exact division.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\circ$ Th1.5.3 (the exact division is invariant of the enlargement of $\mathbb{F}$)}
    Suppose $\mathbb{F}, \mathbb{G}$ are both number fields and $\mathbb{G}\supseteq\mathbb{F}$. Suppose also $f(x), g(x)\in \mathbb{F}$. Then:\\
    $f(x), g(x)\in\mathbb{G}$, and $f(x), g(x)$ keep all relation of exact division when condidered as polynomials in $\mathbb{G}$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious. 
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.6 (the greatest common factor (gcd)) (最大公因式)}
    \begin{compactitem}
        \item Suppose $f(x), g(x), d(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ and $f(x), g(x)$ are not both $0$. Then $d(x)$ is called the greatest common factor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ if:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $d(x)\mid f(x), g(x)$;
            \item For any factor $\varphi(x)$ of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, $d(x)\mid \varphi(x)$.
        \end{compactenum}
        \item We define the only greatest common factor of two zero-polynomials as also $0$.
        \item For a single polynomial $f(x)$ in $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$, we define its greatest common factor(s) as the ones of $f(x)$ and $f(x)$.
    \end{compactitem}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    This definition of gcd derives from the one in the number theory. Obviously one thing proceeds all the discussions about it — the discussion about existence and the uniqueness of gcd.
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{(Existence): for any polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, their gcd exists.} This can be clarified by the Euclidean algorithm (辗转相除法).
        \item \textcolor{Th}{(Uniqueness): for any polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, their gcd is unique regardless of a non-zero constant multiplier.} Namely, if $d_1(x)$ and $d_2(x)$ are both the gcd of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, then $d_1(x) = cd_2(x)$ for some non-zero $c$ in $\mathbb{F}$. This fact is from the definition of gcd itself.
    \end{compactenum}
    \textcolor{Df}{Then we denote the monic (首项系数为一的) gcd of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by $\gcd(f(x), g(x))$.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.6.1 (coprime (互素的) polynomial)}
    Suppose $f(x), g(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. Then $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are called coprime if $\gcd(f(x), g(x)) = 1$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    This definition is also from the elementary number theory.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{$\bullet$ Th1.6.2 (Bezout's theorem)}
    Suppose $f(x), g(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\exists u(x), v(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ such that $u(x)f(x)+v(x)g(x) = \gcd(f(x), g(x))$;
        \item $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are coprime $\Leftrightarrow $ $\exists u(x), v(x)\in \mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x) \text{ such that } u(x)f(x)+v(x)g(x) = 1$.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: \begin{compactenum}
        \item Consider the Euclidean algorithm and let the remainders of the sequence of division equations $E_1, E_2, \dots, E_n$ are $r_1(x), r_2(x), \dots, r_n(x)$. Then by replacing $r_1$ in $E_2$ using $E_1$, replacing $r_2$ in $E_3$ using $E_2$, and so forth, we obtain $u(x)$ and $v(x)$.
        \item `only if' now follows 1., and we now prove `if'. If $u(x)f(x)+v(x)g(x) = 1$ for some $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, then the gcd $d(x)$ of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ divides both of them, and thus divides their combination $u(x)f(x)+v(x)g(x)$, namely, divides $1$. Therefore $d(x) = 1$
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{$\circ$ Th1.6.3 (some useful conclusions)}
    Suppose the polynomials mentioned below are all in $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $g(x)\mid f(x)h(x)$ and $\gcd(f(x), g(x)) = 1$, then $g(x)\mid h(x)$;
        \item If $g_1(x)\mid f(x), g_2(x)\mid f(x)$ and $\gcd(g_1(x), g_2(x)) = 1$, then $g_1(x)g_2(x)\mid f(x)$
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious using the Bezout's theorem.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.7 (gcd in the multi-dimensional cases)}
    \begin{compactitem}
        \item Suppose $f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ where $n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$ and $f_1, \dots, f_n$ are not all zero. Then a polynomial $d(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ is called the greatest common factor of $f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)$ if:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $d(x)\mid f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)$;
            \item For any factor $\varphi(x)$ of all $f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)$, we have $d(x)\mid \varphi(x)$.
        \end{compactenum}
        \item We define the only gcd of arbitrarily finitely many zero-polynomials as also $0$.
    \end{compactitem}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactitem}
        \item This definition is a natural extension to the multi-dimensional cases. \textcolor{Th}{Here we can still clearly confirm the existence and uniqueness (regardless of a non-zero constant multiplier) of the gcd.}
        \item As we cannot carry on the Euclidean algorithm in multi-dimensional cases, the computation of multi-polynomial-gcd is proposed as the theorem here:\\
        \textcolor{Th}{Suppose $F$ is a list of some polynomials in $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. If we partition $F(x)$ by two non-empty and disjoint lists $F_1, F_2$, then $\gcd(F) = \gcd[\gcd(F_1), \gcd(F_2)]$}\\
        The proof of this theorem is also easy just using the definition. And this theorem indicates that we can obtain the gcd of many polynomials, just by computing for any two of them each time and aggregating the results in arbitrary order.
        \item \textcolor{Df}{We still say $f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)$ are coprime if $\gcd(f_1(x), \dots, f_n(x)) = 1$.} And we can see that \textcolor{Th}{the Bezout theorem proposed above still holds for the multi-dimensional cases.}

\begin{Df}{$\bullet$ Df1.8 (irreducible (不可约的) polynomial)}
    \begin{compactitem}
        \item Suppose $p(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ and $\deg p(x)\geq 1$. Then $p(x)$ is called reducible if $\exists g_1(x), g_2(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ such that:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $p(x) = g_1(x)g_2(x)$;
            \item $\deg g_1(x), \deg g_2(x) < \deg p(x)$.
        \end{compactenum}
        \item Suppose $p(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ and $\deg p(x)\geq 1$. Then $p(x)$ is called irreducible if it is not reducible.

\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item The discussion about reducibility of polynomials also derives from elementary number theory.
        \item Generally whether a polynomial is reducible depends on which $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ it lies, since we can often see a polynomials in $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be decomposed of two factors in $\mathbb{R}$, but can be decomposed instead in $\mathbb{C}$.
        \item \textcolor{Th}{According to the definition, a polynomial with degree 1 is always irreducible.}

    Suppose $f(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$ and $\deg f(x)\geq 1$. Then $f(x)$ can be uniquely factorized into a product of irreducible polynomials in $p_1(x), \dots, p_n(x)\in\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. \\
    Here the uniqueness means that:
    if $f(x) = p_1(x)\dots p_n(x) = q_1(x)\dots q_m(x)$ for some irreducible polynomials $p_1(x), \dots, p_n(x), q_1(x), \dots, q_m(x)$, then $n = m$ and $p_i(x)\overset{c}{=}q_i(x)$ for all $i$ after a proper permutation of the indices (``$\overset{c}{=}$'' means the left and the right sides are equal regardless of a non-zero constant multiplier).

        \item Existence: if $f(x)$ is irreducible, then we are done; otherwise, factor $f(x)$. Then we can further factorize the factors of $f(x)$ just yielded, and so forth, until all the factors are irreducible.
        \item Uniqueness: assume that $f(x) = p_1(x)\dots p_n(x) = q_1(x)\dots q_m(x)$ for some irreducible $p_i(x)$'s and $q_j(x)$'s. Then we can see that $p_1(x)\mid f(x) = q_1(x)\dots q_m(x)$, and thus $p_1(x)\mid q_j(x)$ for some $j$. Since $q_j(x)$ is also irreducible, we have $q_j(x)\mid p_1(x)$ (as it is impossible that $\gcd(p_1(x), q_j(x)) = 1$). Hence $p_1(x)\overset{c}{=}q_i(x)$, and then we can remove $p_1(x)$ and $q_i(x)$ from the equation. Next is $p_2(x)$, which is paired in this way with some $q_k(x)$, and so forth. Finally we can obtain that $n = m$ and $p_i(x)\overset{c}{=}q_i(x)$ for all $i$ after a proper permutation of the indices.

    This theorem indicates that an $n$-degree polynomial function is determined by exactly $n+1$ different points. (As for an $-\infty$-degree polynomial, namely, $0$, it is determined by (let us say) $-infty+1=0$ point, which is also true.) \\

To further illustrate this fact, we assume that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{F}$. Since there must be infinitely many $x$ in $\mathbb{F}$ (as $\mathbb{F}\supseteq\mathbb{Q}$), we can see that $f(x) = g(x)$ for infinitely many $x$, and thus the two polynomials are equal.

    \textit{Pf}: Consider $f(x)$ as a real-coefficient polynomial in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{C})$. Then we can take the irreducible factorization for it in the complex way, say $f(x) = c(x-\alpha_1)\dots (x-\alpha_n)$. Now for those $x-\alpha_i$ where $\alpha_i\notin\mathbb{R}$, we paired it with $x-\bar{\alpha_i}$ and merge this couple of factors as a 2-degree one, $(x-\alpha_i)(x-\bar{\alpha_i})$. Hence we can see that this polynomial $(x-\alpha_i)(x-\bar{\alpha_i})$ is real-coefficient, and is irreducible in $\mathbb{R}$ (since its only irreducible factorization is imaginary-coefficient). Therefore, after merging for every pair of imaginary roots, we obtain the irreducible factorization of $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}$, which contains only 1-degree or 2-degree factors.

Suppose $f(x)g(x)$ is not primitive, then there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p\mid c_s$ for all $s$.

Let us say $a_i$ is the first one in $a_0, a_1, \dots$ that $p$ does not divide, and $b_j$ is the first one in $b_0, b_1, \dots$ that $p$ does not divide. Since $p\mid c_{i+j} = a_ib_j+\sum_{k}a_{i+k}b_{j-k}$, where $p$ divides $\sum_{k}a_{i+k}b_{j-k}$ (as $p$ divides either $a$ or $b$ of every term in this sum), we know that $p\mid a_ib_j$, which is a contradiction.

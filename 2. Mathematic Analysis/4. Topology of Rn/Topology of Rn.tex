    \title{\LARGE \textbf{Topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$}}
    \author{\large Jiawei Hu}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is the 4th chapter of Mathematical Analysis, which is about \textbf{Topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$}. By the way, we now pre-claim some commonly-used notations and terms:
\begin{Df}{Notations and Terms}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\mathbb{R}$: the set of the real numbers; $\mathbb{R}_\infty = \mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty, \infty\}$;
        \item $\mathbb{R}^n$: without extra specification, $n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$; 
        \item $\mathbb{Z}$: the set of the integers;
        \item $\mathbb{N}$: the set of the natural numbers;
        \item $\mathbb{N^\ast}$: the set of the positive integers.
        \item An agreement for the length of a list: if we write $a_1, \dots, a_n$, then we indicate that $n$ is finite and that $n\geq 1$; if we write $a_0, \dots, a_n$, then we indicate that $n$ is finite and that $n\geq 0$.
        \item Keep coincident in the notions and notations of functions with the chapter 1 of course 0, including the ones of domain, range, restriction, image, pre-image, inverse and composition. Specifically for a function $f: A\rightarrow B$ and some sets $E\subseteq A$ and $F\subseteq B$, the image of $E$ and the pre-image of $F$ under $f$ are just:
        $$f[E] = \{f(x): x\in E\},\quad f^{-1}[F] = \{x\in A: f(x)\in F\}$$
        \item For the existence of a limit, if we have used the symbol $\lim\limits_{x\to x_0} f(x)$ in an expression (such as an equality, an inequality or some expressions involving some other numbers), then without explicitly specification, we imply that the limit exists (``exist'' means finite according to the chapter 1).
        \item An interval is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of one of the following forms: $(a,b)$, $[a,b]$, $(a,b]$, $[a,b)$, $(a, \infty)$, $(-\infty, b)$, $(-\infty, \infty)$, where $a, b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a<b$. Please identify whether $(a,b)$ stands for a tuple or an open interval from the context by yourself.
        \item Monotonic function: ``increasing'' for ``$\geq$'', ``strictly increasing'' for ``$>$''.
        \item The inner product and norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are the typical ones: $\langle \pmb{x}, \pmb{y}\rangle = x_1y_1 + \dots + x_ny_n$, $\Vert \pmb{x}\Vert = \sqrt{\langle \pmb{x}, \pmb{x}\rangle}$.
        \item $E^c$: Let $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E^c\triangleq \mathbb{R}^n\setminus E$.
        \item A set of sets is called a collection or a family.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

Here is the \textbf{Quick Search} for this chapter:
\begin{Th}{Quick Search}
    \begin{compactdesc}
        \item[] (4.2.*): Open sets and closed sets.
        \item[] (4.3.*): Sequentially compact $\Leftrightarrow$ compact $\Leftrightarrow$ bounded closed.
    \end{compactdesc}
\end{Th}

When I marched this point, I add the \textbf{Pre \& Post Exercise} pattern to the writing, which is shown as the following Th block:

\begin{Th}{Some theorem}
    The text.

    \textcolor{P}{\textit{Analytically}: The pre-exercise part.}\\
    \textit{Pf}: The formal proof.\\
    \textcolor{P}{\textit{Thoughtfully}: The post-exercise part.}
\end{Th}

Then with everything prepared, here we go.

\begin{Df}{Df4.1 (limit of sequence) (extension of Df \{, ID: 1.1\})}
    Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pmb{l}\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\pmb{l}$ is called the \textbf{limit} of the sequence $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ (or $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ \textbf{converges} to $\pmb{l}$), denoted by $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n = \pmb{l}$, if
    $$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N\in\mathbb{N}^\ast, \forall n\geq N, \Vert \pmb{x}_n - \pmb{l}\Vert < \varepsilon.$$
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    We can easily verify the arithmetics:
    \textcolor{Th}{Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ and $\{\pmb{y}_n\}$ are two sequences in $\mathbb{R}^n$, both with their limits in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (\pmb{x}_n\pm\pmb{y}_n) = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n \pm \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{y}_n$;
        \item $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} c\pmb{x}_n = c\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n$ for any $c\in\mathbb{R}$.
    \end{compactenum}}
    And we naturally have:
    \textcolor{Th}{Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pmb{l}\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n = \pmb{l}$ iff every subsequence of $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ converges to $\pmb{l}$.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th4.1.1 (points sequence converges by components)}
    Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pmb{l}\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n = \pmb{l}$ iff $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} x^{(i)}_n = l^{(i)}$ for each $i = 1, \dots, n$, where the superscript ``$(i)$'' denotes the $i$-th component of a vector.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df4.1.2 (Cauchy sequence) (extension of Df \{, ID: 1.6\})}
    Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is called a \textbf{Cauchy sequence} if
    $$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N\in\mathbb{N}^\ast, \left(\forall m,n\geq N\right), \Vert \pmb{x}_m - \pmb{x}_n\Vert < \varepsilon.$$
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th4.1.2.1 (Cauchy criterion) (extension of Th \{, ID: 1.7\})}
    Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ has a limit in $\mathbb{R}^n$ iff $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious if we reduce it to the 1-dimensional case, aware of the ``convergence by components''.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df4.1.3.-1 (bounded set)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is called \textbf{bounded} if there is some positive real number $R$ s.t. $\Vert\pmb{x}\Vert\leq R$ for every $\pmb{x}\in E$. Otherwise, $E$ is called \textbf{unbounded}.
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th4.1.3 (Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem) (extension of Th \{, ID: 1.5\})}
    Suppose $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ is a bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ has a convergent subsequence.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious if we reduce it to the 1-dimensional case, aware of the ``convergence by components''. Actually, for the 1st component of the sequence, it is bounded and thus has a convergent subsequence; then for the 2nd component of this subsequence, it is bounded and thus has a convergent sub-subsequence; and so on.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df4.2 (open ball) (extension of Df \{, ID: 2.1.-1\})}
    Suppose $\pmb{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $r$ is a positive real number. Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $B_r(\pmb{a})\triangleq \{\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n: \Vert \pmb{x}-\pmb{a}\Vert < r\}$ is called the \textbf{open ball} of radius $r$ centered at $\pmb{a}$.
        \item $\bar{B}_r(\pmb{a})\triangleq \{\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n: \Vert \pmb{x}-\pmb{a}\Vert \leq r\}$ is called the \textbf{closed ball} of radius $r$ centered at $\pmb{a}$.
        \item $\check{B}_r(\pmb{a})\triangleq \{\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n: 0 < \Vert \pmb{x}-\pmb{a}\Vert < r\}$ is called the \textbf{hollow open ball} of radius $r$ centered at $\pmb{a}$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Df}{Df4.2.1 (open set)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $\pmb{a}\in E$, then $\pmb{a}$ is called an \textbf{interior point} of $E$ if there exists an open ball $B_r(\pmb{a})$ such that $B_r(\pmb{a})\subseteq E$;
        \item The set of all interior points of $E$ is called the \textbf{interior} of $E$, denoted by $E^\circ$ (or $\text{int}(E)$);
        \item $E$ is called an \textbf{open set} if $E^\circ = E$;
        \item $E$ is called a \textbf{closed set} if $E^c$ is open.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    We find that \textcolor{Th}{an open ball is an open set, a hollow open ball is an open set, a closed ball is a closed set}. Here the ``open'' and ``closed'' are not disjoint, since \textcolor{Th}{$\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\varnothing$ are both open and closed}, and \textcolor{Th}{there are sets that are neither open nor closed (e.g. $(0,1]$).}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th4.2.2 (union and intersection of open sets and closed sets)}
    In $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item The union of any collection of open sets is open;
        \item The intersection of finitely many open sets is open;
        \item The union of finitely many closed sets is closed;
        \item The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: (1) is natural. For (2), suppose $E_1, \dots, E_n$ are open. Then for any $\pmb{a}\in E_1\cap\dots\cap E_n$, there exist $r_1, \dots, r_n$ such that $B_{r_1}(\pmb{a})\subseteq E_1, \dots, B_{r_n}(\pmb{a})\subseteq E_n$. Let $r = \min\{r_1, \dots, r_n\}$, so that $B_r(\pmb{a})\subseteq E_1\cap\dots\cap E_n$. (3) and (4) are natural by De Morgan's laws. 
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    Let us talk about why (2) is not true for an infinite collection of open sets. Consider the collection $\{B_{1/n}(0): n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast\}$. Then $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty B_{1/n}(0) = \{0\}$, which is not open.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{Df4.2.3 (limit point) (focal point) (extension of Df \{, ID: 2.1.-2\})}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pmb{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\pmb{a}$ is called a \textbf{limit point} (or \textbf{focal point}) of $E$ if $E$ intersects every hollow open ball centered at $\pmb{a}$.
\end{Df}
    
\begin{Rmk}{}
    The equivalent definition of a limit point is: \textcolor{Df}{Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\pmb{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\pmb{a}$ is a limit point of $E$ if there is a sequence $\{\pmb{x}_n\}$ in $E\setminus\{\pmb{a}\}$ s.t. $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \pmb{x}_n = \pmb{a}$.}\\
    \textcolor{Df}{Let $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the set of all limit points of $E$, denoted by $E^\prime$, is called the \textbf{derived set} of $E$. If a point $\pmb{a}$ is not a limit point of $E$, then $\pmb{a}$ is called an \textbf{isolated point} of $E$. Call the set $E\cup E^\prime$ the \textbf{closure} of $E$, denoted by $\overline{E}$.} We can then see these natural facts: 
    \textcolor{Th}{The following $E$, $r$ and $\pmb{a}$ are all arbitrary:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $E^\prime$ and $\overline{E}$ are both closed;
        \item $[B_r(\pmb{a})]^\prime = [\check{B}_r(\pmb{a})]^\prime = [\bar{B}_r(\pmb{a})]^\prime = \bar{B}_r(\pmb{a})$;
        \item $E^\circ$ is the largest open set contained in $E$, $\overline{E}$ is the smallest closed set containing $E$.
    \end{compactenum}}
    \textcolor{Df}{For a subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we call those points in $(E^c)^\circ$ the \textbf{exterior points} of $E$, the set of all outer points of $E$ the \textbf{exterior} of $E$, denoted by $\text{ext}(E)$; call those points that are neither interior points nor exterior points of $E$ the \textbf{boundary points} of $E$, and the set of all boundary points of $E$ the \textbf{boundary} of $E$, denoted by $\partial E$.} 
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th4.2.4 ($E$ is closed iff $E = \overline{E}$)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is closed iff $E = \overline{E}$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Ex4.2.5 ($\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are the only two sets that are both open and closed)}
    In $\mathbb{R}^n$, are $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ the only two sets that are both open and closed?
    \tcblower
    \textit{Answer}: Yes.\\
    \textit{Solution}: If some set $E$ (neither $\varnothing$ nor $\mathbb{R}^n$) is both open and closed, then both $E$ and $E^c$ are open. To search for idea and simplify the thought, we first consider $E$ to be an open ball. Then we have known that $E^c$ cannot be open, which is due to the boundary of the ball $E$. \\
    Then we think of that the an arbitrary set $E$ cannot be both open and closed if it has some boundary points. Actually, if $E$ is both open and closed, and $E$ has some boundary points $\pmb{x}$, then $\pmb{x}\notin E^\circ = E$ and $\pmb{x}\notin (E^c)^\circ = E^c$, impossible. \\
    Then how to prove that except for $\varnothing$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, any other subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ has some boundary points? Since $E$ and $E^c$ are both non-empty, we find a point $\pmb{x}\in E$ and another point $\pmb{y}\in E^c$. As we can imagine, if moving from $\pmb{x}$ to $\pmb{y}$ along the line segment gradually, from $E^\circ$ to $(E^c)^\circ$, we must pass through some boundary points somewhere. \\
    Now is the formal proof. Suppose $\varnothing\subsetneq E\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then there are some $\pmb{x}\in E$ and $\pmb{y}\in E^c$. Consider the set
    $$\Lambda = \{\lambda\in [0,1]: \pmb{x}+\lambda(\pmb{y}-\pmb{x})\in E^\circ\}.$$
    If $\Lambda = \varnothing$, then $\pmb{x} = \pmb{x}+0(\pmb{y}-\pmb{x})\notin E^\circ$ and thus $\pmb{x}\in\partial E$. Suppose $\Lambda\neq\varnothing$, then $0\leq\inf\Lambda\leq\sup\Lambda\leq 1$. Consider the critical point $\pmb{z} = \pmb{x}+\lambda_0(\pmb{y}-\pmb{x})$ where $\lambda_0 = \inf\Lambda$. Then we can show that $\pmb{z}\in\partial E$:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\pmb{z}\notin E^\circ$: If otherwise $\pmb{z}\in E^\circ$, then there is some $B_r(\pmb{z})\subseteq E$, and thus $\pmb{z}^\prime\triangleq \pmb{z}+\frac{r}{2}\frac{\pmb{y}-\pmb{x}}{\Vert\pmb{y}-\pmb{x}\Vert}\in E^\circ$, which contradicts that $\lambda_0$ is an upper bound of $\Lambda$;
        \item $\pmb{z}\notin (E^c)^\circ$: If otherwise $\pmb{z}\in (E^c)^\circ$, then there is some $B_r(\pmb{z})\subseteq E^c$. But since $\lambda_0$ is the least upper bound of $\Lambda$, there is some $\lambda^\prime\in\Lambda$ s.t. $\lambda^\prime>\lambda_0-\frac{r}{\Vert\pmb{y}-\pmb{x}\Vert}$ (namely $\pmb{z}^\prime \triangleq \pmb{x}+\lambda^\prime(\pmb{y}-\pmb{x})\in E^\circ\subseteq E$), which contradicts that $\pmb{z}^\prime\in B_r(\pmb{z})\subseteq E^c$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th} 

\begin{Rmk}{}
    This exercise obtain a byproduct: \textcolor{Th}{Every non-empty proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ has some boundary points.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{Df4.2.6.-1 (diameter)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the \textbf{diameter} of $E$, denoted by $\text{diam}(E)$, is defined as
    $$\text{diam}(E) = \sup\{\Vert\pmb{x}-\pmb{y}\Vert: \pmb{x}, \pmb{y}\in E\}.$$
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th4.2.6 (theorem of nested closed sets) (extension of Th \{, ID: 1.4\})}
    Suppose $\{F_i: i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a sequence of non-empty closed sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F_1\supseteq F_2\supseteq F_3\supseteq \cdots$. Suppose also $\text{diam}(F_i)\rightarrow 0$. Then there is exactly one point in $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty F_i$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Since each $F_i$ is non-empty, find some $\pmb{x}_i\in F_i$ for each $i$. Clearly the sequence $X_i\triangleq\{\pmb{x}_i, \pmb{x}_{i+1}, \dots\}$ is in $F_i$. Since $\text{diam}(F_i)\rightarrow 0$, each $X_i$ is a Cauchy sequence, and different $X_i$ converge to some common $\pmb{x}$. Then for each $i$,
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If all terms (or all terms after some term) in $X_i$ are $\pmb{x}$, then $\pmb{x}\in F_i$;
        \item If there are always some term in $X_i$ that is not $\pmb{x}$, then choose these points as a subsequence $Y_i$ of $X_i$, and thus $Y_i$ is a sequence in $F_i\setminus\{\pmb{x}\}$ convergent to $\pmb{x}$, indicating that $\pmb{x}\in F_i^\prime\subseteq F_i$;
    \end{compactenum}
    that is, $\pmb{x}\in F_i$. Hence $\pmb{x}\in\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty F_i$.\\
    Easy to verify that $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty F_i$ contains only $\pmb{x}$.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df4.3.1 (sequentially compact sets (列紧集))}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is said to be sequentially compact if every sequence in $E$ has some subsequence who converges to some limit in $E$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th4.3.1.1 (sequentially compact sets are exactly bounded closed sets)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is sequentially compact iff $E$ is a bounded closed set.

\begin{Df}{Df4.3.2.-1 (open cover (开覆盖))}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\{A_\lambda: \lambda\in\Lambda\}$ is a collection of open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\{A_\lambda\}$ is called an \textbf{open cover} of $E$ if $E\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{\lambda\in\Lambda} A_\lambda$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Df}{Df4.3.2 (compact sets (紧致集))}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is said to be compact if: \\
    For every open cover $\{A_\lambda: \lambda\in\Lambda\}$ of $E$, there are finitely many $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m$ s.t. $E\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^m A_{\lambda_i}$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    In a word, a compact set is a set such that every open cover of it has a finite subcover. In $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have defined a more general concept of open cover than that in $\mathbb{R}$, the latter of which is just a collection of open intervals. And with this more general concept, we can extend the finite-covering theorem (or the Heine-Borel theorem) in $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ as follows.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th4.3.2.1 (compact sets are exactly bounded closed sets) (finite-covering theorem) (Heine-Borel theorem)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $E$ is compact iff $E$ is a bounded closed set.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item ``only if'': Suppose $E$ is compact. Then $E$ is obviously bounded as we can use finitely many open balls in the open cover $\{B_N(\pmb{0}): N\in\mathbb{N}^\ast\}$ to cover $E$. To prove that $E$ is closed is to prove that $E^c$ is open, namely, to find an open ball centered at $\pmb{y}$ for each point $\pmb{y}\in E^c$. Since for every point $\pmb{x}\in E$, there is an appropriate radius $r(\pmb{x})$ s.t. $B_{r(\pmb{x})}(\pmb{x})\cap B_{r(\pmb{x})}(\pmb{y}) = \varnothing$, we collect all these balls to form an open cover
        $$\{B_{r(\pmb{x})}(\pmb{x}): \pmb{x}\in E\}$$
        of $E$. Then there is an finite subcover $\{B_{r_1}(\pmb{x}_1), \cdots, B_{r_m}(\pmb{x}_m)\}$ of $E$. Hence we can then choose the minimum radius $r = \min\{r_1, \dots, r_m\}$ to ensure that $B_r(\pmb{y})\cap \bigcup_{i=1}^m B_{r_i}(\pmb{x}_i) = \varnothing$, which means that $B_r(\pmb{y})\subseteq E^c$.
        \item ``if'': Obviously we need to prove with contradiction. Suppose $E$ is bounded and closed, but there is an open cover $\{A_\lambda: \lambda\in\Lambda\}$ of $E$ that has no finite subcover. \\
        To search for contradiction, we can try to prove that $E$ is not closed, i.e., to find a point $\pmb{x}$ s.t. $\pmb{x}\in E^\prime$ but $\pmb{x}\notin E$ (of course this is just a try which is not necessary the final solution). Then it naturally comes to the nested closed sets theorem since this theorem is powerful in finding some singular point. Then we just assume that $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ for simplicity. \\
        First find a Rectangle $H_1$ s.t. $H_1\supseteq E$. Then divide $H_1$ into 4 equal rectangles (just cut $H_1$ with a cross), and find one of them, say $H_2$, s.t. $H_2\cap E$ cannot be covered by finitely many $A_\lambda$. Then divide $H_2$ into 4 equal rectangles, and find one of them, say $H_3$, s.t. $H_3\cap E$ cannot be covered by finitely many $A_\lambda$. And so on. Then we can find a sequence of nested closed sets $(H_1\cap E)\supseteq (H_2\cap E)\supseteq (H_3\cap E)\supseteq \cdots$ s.t. 
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $\text{diam}(H_i\cap E)\rightarrow 0$;
            \item $H_i\cap E$ cannot be covered by finitely many $A_\lambda$ (let alone $H_i$).
        \end{compactenum}
        Then there is exactly one point $\pmb{x}\in\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty (H_i\cap E) = E\cap \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty H_i$. Since $\pmb{x}\in E$, there is some $A_{\lambda_0}$ s.t. $\pmb{x}\in A_{\lambda_0}$, and thus there is some open ball $B_r(\pmb{x})\subseteq A_{\lambda_0}$. Then those $H_i$ small enough will be contained in $B_r(\pmb{x})$ and thus covered by $A_{\lambda_0}$, which contradicts that $H_i$ cannot be covered by finitely many $A_\lambda$.

    The definition is constructed as an extension of the one of intervals in $\mathbb{R}$, as we will see that many properties of real functions hold on intervals, i.e., on some kinds of sets that are ``connected'' or ``not separated''. To depict this property of ``connected'' mathematicians proposed this definition.\\

        \item ``only if'': Suppose $E$ is connected. If otherwise $E$ is not an interval, then there are some $x\in (\inf E, \sup E)$ s.t. $x\notin E$. Let $A = E\cap (-\infty, x)\cap E$ and $B = E\cap (x, \infty)$, then $E = A\cup B$ is a non-empty-disjoint partition of $E$ and thus, say, $A^\prime\cap B\neq\varnothing$. Let $a\in A^\prime\cap B$, then it is clear that $a\leq x$ since $a\in A^\prime$. But $a>x$ since $a\in B$, which is a contradiction.
        \item ``if'': Suppose $E$ is an interval. If otherwise a non-empty-disjoint partition $E = A\cup B$ of $E$ satisfies $A\cap B^\prime = A^\prime\cap B = \varnothing$. \\ 
        First take $a_0\in A$ and $b_0\in B$, then start the dichotomy from the interval $[a_0, b_0]$ (let us say $a_0<b_0$). If the midpoint of the current interval is in $A$ (resp. in $B$), then let the next interval be the left half (resp. right half) of the current interval. Then we obtain the nested closed intervals $\{[a_i, b_i]\}$ s.t. $a_i\in A$ and $b_i\in B$ for each $i$, and thus there is a point $x\in\bigcap_i [a_i, b_i]$. Since $E$ is an interval and $x\in [a_0, b_0]$, $x\in E$. Now $x$ must in one of $A$ and $B$. Say $x\in A$, then $x\notin B$ so that $b_i\rightarrow x$ and $b_i\neq x$, and thus $x\in A\cap B^\prime$, which contradicts $A\cap B^\prime = \varnothing$.

    Here each of the $\varphi_i$ is defined on and is continuous on $[a,b]$. Actually it is more appropriate to say ``interval-continuous'' according to our convention, but never mind since for a real function defined on a closed interval, ``continuous'' is the same as ``interval-continuous''.

    This definition also reveals some kind of ``connectedness'' of a set, and we can see that the path-connectedness is much more intuitive than connectedness defined before.

\begin{Th}{Th4.4.3.2 (for open sets, path-connected $\Leftrightarrow$ connected)}
    Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set. Then $E$ is connected iff $E$ is path-connected.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: If otherwise $E$ is connected but not path-connected, then there are two points $\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}\in E$ which cannot be connected by a continuous curve in $E$. Consider the set $P(\pmb{x})$ of all points in $E$ that can be path-connected to $\pmb{x}$. Then for each $\pmb{x}^\prime\in P(\pmb{x})$, there is some $B_r(\pmb{x}^\prime)\subseteq E$. Hence $\pmb{x}$ can be path-connected to every points in $B_r(\pmb{x}^\prime)$ and thus $B_r(\pmb{x}^\prime)\subseteq P(\pmb{x})$, implying that $P(\pmb{x})$ is open. Also, we know that for each $\pmb{a}\in E$, the set $P(\pmb{a})$ defined similarly is open. \\
    Now consider the non-empty-disjoint partition $E = P(\pmb{x})\cup \bigcup_{\pmb{a}\in E\setminus P(\pmb{x})}P(\pmb{a})\triangleq A\cup B$, where both $A$ and $B$ are open. Contradicts that $E$ is connected.\\
    \textcolor{P}{\textit{Thoughtfully}: Firstly, prove by contradiction to convert the constructive proof to verifiable proof.

\begin{Th}{Ex4.4.3.3 (connected $\nRightarrow$ path-connected)}
    Find an example of a connected set that is not path-connected.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}: In $\mathbb{R}^2$, consider the set $E = \{(x, \sin\frac{1}{x}): x\in (0,\frac{2}{\pi}]\}$. Then we prove that $\overline{E}$ is connected but not path-connected. \\
    (Note: here $\sin$ is the sine function. Although we have not learned the triangular functions for the sake of rigor (as we need power series to define them), we have learned their basic properties in high school. Just work with them now as there is no cycle reasoning.)\\
    A trivial lemma: \textcolor{Th}{Suppose $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is connected. Then $\overline{E}$ is connected.} Then since $E$ defined here is path-connected, $\overline{E}$ is connected. \\
    Now we prove that $\overline{E}$ is not path-connected. Since $\overline{E} = E\cup\{(0, y): y\in [-1,1]\}$, we claim that there is no continuous curve in $\overline{E}$ that connects $(0,0)$ and $(2/\pi, 1)$. \\
    If otherwise $l = \{(x(t), y(t)): t\in [a,b]\}\subseteq \overline{E}$ connects $(0,0)$ and $(2/\pi, 1)$, say $a=0$, $b=1$, $(x(0), y(0)) = (0,0)$ and $(x(1), y(1)) = (2/\pi, 1)$, then 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\lim\limits_{t\to 0^+} x(t) = x(0) = 0$;
        \item $\lim\limits_{t\to 0^+} y(t) = y(0) = 0$;
    \end{compactenum}
    Now let $m_0 = 0$, $t_0=1$ and $x_0 = 2/[(1+4m_0)\pi] = 2/\pi$, then $x(t_0) = x_0$. 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Since $x(\cdot)$ is continuous on $[0,1/2]$, the range of $x(\cdot)$ on $[0,1/2]$ is $[0, M_1]$ ($M_1 = \max_{t\in[0,1/2]}x(t)$). Then choose an integer $m_1$ s.t. $m_1>m_0$ and $x_1\triangleq 2/[(1+4m_1)\pi]\in [0, M_1]$, so that $x_1 = x(t_1)$ for some $t_1\in (0, 1/2]$.
        \item Since $x(\cdot)$ is continuous on $[0,1/4]$, the range of $x(\cdot)$ on $[0,1/4]$ is $[0, M_2]$ ($M_2 = \max_{t\in[0,1/4]}x(t)$). Then choose an integer $m_2$ s.t. $m_2>m_1$ and $x_2\triangleq 2/[(1+4m_2)\pi]\in [0, M_2]$, so that $x_2 = x(t_2)$ for some $t_2\in (0, 1/4]$.
        \item $\cdots$
    \end{compactenum}
    Then we obtain a sequence $\{t_i\}$ s.t.
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $t_i\rightarrow 0$ and $t_i\neq 0$;
        \item $x_i = x(t_i) = 2/[(1+4m_i)\pi]\rightarrow 0$ (since $m_i\rightarrow\infty$);
    \end{compactenum}
    Hence we find the following contradiction:
    $$ 0 = \lim\limits_{t\to 0^+} y(t) = \lim\limits_{i\to\infty} y(t_i) \overset{x_i\neq 0}{=} \lim\limits_{i\to\infty} \sin\frac{1}{x_i} = \lim\limits_{i\to\infty} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2m_i\pi\right) = 1. $$

\begin{Th}{Ex4.4.3.3 (connected $\nRightarrow$ path-connected) — continued}
    \textcolor{P}{\textit{Thoughtfully}: it is how to find such a set $E$ that troubles us.\\
    To find and prove such a set $E$, we cannot avoid such statement ``there is no path in $E$ connecting $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{y}$'' or ``if otherwise there is a path in $E$ connecting $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{y}$'', which would brought immense troubles as we often cannot enumerate all the possible paths connecting $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{y}$, of a huge variety of shapes especially in some trivial suspects (balls, rectangles, \dots). But what if we can limit the shape of the path? The ideal case is that $E$ is a curve, say, a line segment, so that every path in $E$ becomes very trivial.\\
    A line-segment $AB$ is path-connected, so we need some modification for it. A set $E$ which contains some path-separated pair $(x,y)$ of points must have:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Every path connecting $x$ and $y$ is cut off by some point not in $E$;
        \item Every path in $E$ starting from $x$ can never reaches $y$.
    \end{compactenum}
    If we construct $E$ by (1), we are to remove some points from the line segment $AB$. Removing one point, finitely many points, or a convergent sequence of points will not work, as this will directly lead to an unconnected $E$, neither will removing all rational points.
    If we construct $E$ by (2), we are to add some points to $AB$ which cannot be reached by any path starting from $AB$. Sadly the newly added points cannot be isolated (i.e., not in the derived set of $AB$) as otherwise $E$ is again unconnected, and then we have no idea since no extra point is a limit point of $AB$.\\
    But can we find such an extra limit point if $AB$ is not a line segment? Or can we twist the shape of $AB$ to make some other point $y$ approachable in any extent but never reachable? Imagine drawing $AB$ horizontally on a piece of paper, say $A=(0,0)$ and $B=(1,0)$, and choosing $y=(1,1)$. Then we can make the line segment repeatedly bulge upwards as moving from $A$ to $B$, in every effort, for infinitely many times, to approach $y$. This way we finally achieve the goal.\\
    So far we have see the key to find such a set $E$: a curve, unlimitedly twisted or oscillating in a limited space. And there is a typical example of such characteristic: the curve $\{(x,y): y=\sin(1/x)\}$.}

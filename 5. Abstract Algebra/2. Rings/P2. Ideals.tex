\maketitle

This is about the \textbf{Ideals}. By the way, we now pre-claim some commonly-used notations and terms:
\begin{Df}{Notations and Terms}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item An agreement for the length of a list: if we write $a_1, \dots, a_n$, then we indicate that $n$ is finite and that $n\geq 1$; if we write $a_0, \dots, a_n$, then we indicate that $n$ is finite and that $n\geq 0$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

Here is the \textbf{Quick Search} for this chapter:

Then with everything prepared, here we go. 

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P2.4.1 (subrings and ideals)}
    Let $R$ be a ring. 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item A subset $S$ of $R$ is called a \textbf{subring} of $R$ if $S$ is a ring under the addition and multiplication of $R$, denoted personally by $S\subr R$.
        \item A subring $I$ of $R$ is called a \textbf{left ideal} (resp. \textbf{right ideal}) if
        $$ rx\in I \qquad (\text{resp. }\; xr\in I) $$
        for all $r\in R$ and $x\in I$. If $I$ is both a left ideal and a right ideal of $R$, then $I$ is called an \textbf{ideal} of $R$, denoted personally by $I\ideal R$.
        \item The \textbf{center} of $R$, denoted personally by $\cent R$, is the set
        $$ \cent R = \{c\in R:\, cr = rc \,\text{ for all }\, r\in R\} $$ 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th 2\_P2.4.1.1 (judgement of subrings and ideals)}
    Let $(R, +, \times)$ be a ring.
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item A subset $S$ of $R$ is a subring of $R$ iff
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $(S,+) < (R,+)$ (that is, $S$ is a subgroup of $R$ under the addition of $R$);
            \item $S$ is closed under ``$\times$''.
        \end{compactenum}
        \item A subset $I$ of $R$ is a left (resp. right) ideal of $R$ iff
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $(I,+) < (R,+)$;
            \item $rx\in I$ (resp. $xr\in I$) for all $r\in R$ and $x\in I$.
        \end{compactenum}

    \textit{Pf}: Obvious.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P2.4.1.2 (generated ideal)}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item For a ring $R$, define the ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) \textbf{generated by} a non-empty subset $X$ (similar to the Df \{, ID: 1.7.2\}).
        \item The ideal generated by $X$ is denoted by $(X)$; the elements of $X$ are called \textbf{generators} of $(X)$. If $X$ is finite, say $X = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$, then $(X)$ is said to be \textbf{finitely generated}, and we write $(X) = (x_1, \cdots, x_n)$. 
        \item An ideal $(x)$ generated by a single element $x$ is called a \textbf{principal ideal}. A \textbf{principal ideal ring} is a ring in which every ideal is principal. A principal ideal ring which is an integral domain is called a \textbf{principal ideal domain} (personally abbreviated as PID).
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Th}{Th 2\_P2.4.1.3 (which elements are in generated ideals)}
    Let $R$ be a ring. For $a\in R$ and $X\subseteq R$, then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item The principal ideal $(a)$ is
        $$ (a) = \left\{na+ra+as+\sum_{i=1}^{m}r_i a s_i:\; n\in \mathbb{Z}, m\in \mathbb{N}^\ast, \; r, s, r_i, s_i\in R \right\}. $$
        \item If $R$ has an identity, then
        $$ (a) = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i a s_i:\; m\in \mathbb{N}^\ast, \; r_i, s_i\in R \right\}. $$
        \item If $a\in\cent R$ (in particular if $R$ is commutative), then
        $$ (a) = \left\{na+ra:\; n\in \mathbb{Z}, r\in R \right\}. $$
        \item $Ra \triangleq \{ra:\; r\in R\}$ (resp. $aR \triangleq \{ar:\; r\in R\}$) is a left ideal (resp. right ideal) of $R$ (It is not necessary that $a\in Ra$ (resp. $a\in aR$)). If $R$ has an identity, then $a\in Ra\cap aR$; if $R$ has an identity and $a\in\cent R$, then $Ra = (a) = aR$. 
        \item If $R$ has an identity and $X\subseteq\cent R$ (in particular if $R$ is commutative), then
        $$ (X) = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i:\; m\in \mathbb{N}^\ast, r_i\in R, x_i\in X \right\}. $$
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Prove the first statement and the rest are straightforward results from it. \\
    The proof is easy, and we just talk about how to derive the first statement. The idea is to gradually expand a subset $I$ containing $a$ to an ideal. An ideal $I$ must be subring, and thus must be closed under addition and multiplication, and thus $\{na\}, \{a^k\}\subseteq I$, and thus
    $\{na+a^k\}\subseteq I$. Then $I$ must be closed under (two-sided) multiplication by $r\in R$, and thus $\{rna+nas+ra^k+a^ls+ra^ms\}\subseteq I$. Then after some reductions for the form we get the first statement.
\end{Th}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    Some examples of subrings and ideals:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item ($\mathbb{Z}$) \textcolor{Th}{Of the ring $(\mathbb{Z},+,\times)$, every (additive) subgroup, $n\mathbb{Z}$, is a principal ideal ($n\mathbb{Z} = (n) = (-n)$).}
        \item ($\cent R$) \textcolor{Th}{The center of a ring is a subring, but is not necessarily an ideal.} For example, \textcolor{Th}{
        $$ \cent\mathcal{M}_2(\mathbb{R}) = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
            a & 0 \\
            0 & a
        \end{bmatrix} : a\in \mathbb{R} \right\} $$
        which is not an ideal of $S$.}
        \item (Intersection) \textcolor{Th}{The intersection of any family of subrings (resp. left ideals) (resp. right ideals) (resp. ideals) of a ring is a subring (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) (resp. ideal) of the ring.} 
        \item (Homomorphism) \textcolor{Th}{A ring homomorphism preserves the subring structure in both directions.} That is, for any ring homomorphism $f: R\to S$, if $Q\subr R$ (resp. $T\subr S$), then $f(Q)\subr S$ (resp. $f^{-1}(T)\subr R$). \textcolor{Th}{For a ring homomorphism $f: R\to S$, we have $\Ker f\ideal R$, but not necessarily $\Ima f\ideal S$.} For example the image of the inclusion map $\mathbb{Z}\mapsto \mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, which is not an ideal of $\mathbb{Q}$, as $(1/2)\times 3\notin \mathbb{Z}$.
        \item (Proper ideal) \textcolor{Th}{Let $R$ be a ring. Then $\{0\}$ (called the \textbf{trivial ideal}) and $R$ are both ideals of $R$.} \textcolor{Df}{An ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) $I$ of $R$ is called a \textbf{proper} ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) if $I\neq \{0\}$ and $I\neq R$.} \textcolor{Th}{If $R$ has an identity, then an ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) $I$ of $R$ equals $R$ iff $1\in I$.} Consequently, \textcolor{Th}{a non-zero ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) $I$ of a ring $R$ with identity is proper iff $I$ contains no unit of $R$.}
        \item (Not principal) \textcolor{Th}{In the ring $R$ of all real functions $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, the set $I = \{f\in R:\; f(7) = 0\}$ is a principal ideal, generated by the function $g$ s.t. $g(7) = 0$ and $g(x) = 1$ for all $x\neq 7$.} However, \textcolor{Th}{in the ring $R$ of all continuous real functions $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, the ideal $I = \{f\in R:\; f(7) = 0\}$ is a not principal.} 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th 2\_P2.4.1.3.0.1}
    Let $R$ be a ring with identity. Then an ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) $I$ of $R$ equals $R$ iff $1\in I$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Already proved in the Rmk \{, ID: 2\_P2.4.1.3\}. Here we mention it just because this is commonly used in proofs.
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Th 2\_P2.4.1.3.1 (division ring $\overset{?}{\Longleftrightarrow}$ no proper ideals)}
    Let $R$ be a non-zero ring. Then
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $R$ is a division ring, then $R$ has no proper left (resp. right) ideals.
        \item If $R$ has no proper left (resp. right) ideals, then $R^2 = 0$ or $R$ is a division ring.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Left ideals and right ideals are similar, so we only prove the case of left ideals. 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $R$ is a division ring, then every non-zero left ideal $I$ of $R$ must contain some unit, so that $I = R$.
        \item Prove by the following steps:
        \begin{compactitem}
            \item Clearly the set $\text{Ann}_{\text{r}}(R) \triangleq \{a\in R:\; Ra = 0\}$ is an ideal of $R$ (and thus a left ideal). Then $\text{Ann}_{\text{r}}(R) = 0$ or $\text{Ann}_{\text{r}}(R) = R$. For the latter case we get $R^2 = 0$. Now assume $\text{Ann}_{\text{r}}(R) = 0$, and then for all $a\neq 0$ we have $0\neq Ra\ideal R$, and thus $Ra = R$. 
            \item Now claim that $R$ has no zero divisors so that the two-sided cancellation law holds. If $ab=0$ and $b\neq 0$, then we must have $a=0$. In fact the left ideal $\text{Ann}_{\text{l}}(b) = \{r\in R:\; rb = 0\}$ is $0$, since if otherwise $\text{Ann}_{\text{l}}(b) = R$ we have $rb=0$ for all $r\in R$, contradicting $Rb=R$. Thus $a\in\text{Ann}_{\text{l}}(b) = \{0\}$, the claim is true. 
            \item For some $0\neq a\in R$ we have $Ra = R$, so that $Ra\ni a = ea$ for some $0\neq e\in R$. Then $$ a = ea \implies a^2 = aea \implies a = ae $$
            by the cancellation law. Then we will show that $e$ is the identity of $R$. 
            \item For any $0\neq b\in R$ we have the following (use the cancellation law):
            $$ \begin{aligned}
                ea = a &\implies bea = ba \implies be = b \\
                ae = a &\implies aeb = ab \implies eb = b 
            \end{aligned} $$
            and thus $e$ is the identity of $R$, denoted by $e=1$.
            \item Finally prove that $R$ is a division ring. For any $0\neq a\in R$ we have $Ra\ni 1 = ca$ for some $0\neq c\in R$; for this $0\neq c\in R$ we have $R\ni 1 = dc$ for some $0\neq d\in R$. Then $c$ is both left and right invertible, and thus its left and right inverses coinside, $d=a$. Thus $a$ is a unit, and then $R$ is a division ring.
        \end{compactitem}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P2.4.1.4 (subset addition and multiplication in a ring)}
    Let $R$ be a ring. 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item The \textbf{subset addition} of $R$ follows from the Df \{, ID: 1.10\}, treating $R$ as an group under addition.
        \item The \textbf{subset multiplication} of $R$ is defined as (for $A, B\subseteq R$):
        $$ AB = \{a_1b_1 + \cdots + a_nb_n:\; n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast, a_i\in A, b_i\in B\} $$
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Th}{The subset multiplication is not defined as $AB = \{ab\}$ because if so the distributive law $A(B+C) = AB + AC$ (talked below) would not hold.}

\begin{Th}{Th 2\_P2.4.1.4.1 (properties of subset addition and multiplication)}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $A$, $B$, $C$ are all ideals (resp. left ideals) (resp. right ideals) of $R$. Then
    \begin{compactenum}

        \item (Commutativity of addition) $A+B = B+A$.
        \item (Assotiativity of addition) $A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C$. \textcolor{Df}{By this we can define $A_1 + \cdots + A_n$.}
        \item (Closed under multiplication) $AB$ is an ideal (resp. left ideal) (resp. right ideal) of $R$.
        \item (Assotiativity of multiplication) $A(BC) = (AB)C$. \textcolor{Df}{By this we can define $A_1 \cdots A_n$ (in particular, $\underbrace{A\cdots A}_{n} \triangleq A^n$)} And we have

        \item ((Two-sided) Distributivity) $A(B+C) = AB + AC$ and $(B+C)A = BA + CA$.
        \item (Inclusion) $A_1\cdots A_n \,\subseteq\, A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n \,\subseteq\, A_1+\cdots + A_n$.

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P2.4.2 (quotient rings)}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $I\ideal R$. Then the quotient group of $R$ by $I$ (since as additive group, $I\nles R$), $R/I$, \textcolor{Th}{forms a ring under the following well-defined addition and multiplication,} called the \textbf{quotient ring} (or \textbf{factor ring}) of $R$ by $I$.
    \begin{compactenum}

        \item (Multiplication) $(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I$.

    \textcolor{Th}{For the quotient ring $R/I$

    \end{compactenum}}
    Later we will see that what an ideal is in a ring is similar to what a normal subgroup is in a group, as those isomorphism theorems for groups are also true for rings (extended to ideals). Then the \textcolor{Df}{\textbf{normal subgroup-ideal analogy} $\mathcal{A}$ needs to be specified:

        \item Group homomorphisms $\leftrightarrow$ ring homomorphisms;

        \item (For the notations) $G\leftrightarrow R$, $H\leftrightarrow S$, $N\leftrightarrow I$, $M\leftrightarrow J$, $K\leftrightarrow Q$, $L\leftrightarrow T$.
    \end{compactenum}}
    Many of the following theorems is a direct extension of the corresponding group theorems, under this analogy. In other words, \textbf{just replacing the group terms in the group theorems (including their proofs or solutions) with the ring terms we can get the ring theorems (including their proofs or solutions).} Here we give an summary of these theorems (convenient for the readers to remember), and state their content more detailedly in the several following Th blocks.

    For any $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n)\in A_1\times A_2\cdots\times A_n$, there is some $(a_1, \ast, \cdots, \ast)\in A$, and thus

    And so forth, we have $(0, a_2, \cdots, 0)\in A$, \; $\cdots$ \;, $(0, \cdots, 0, a_n)\in A$, and then

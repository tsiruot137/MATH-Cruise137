This file is about the \textbf{Polynomial Rings, Matrix Rings and Group Rings}. 

Here is the \textbf{Quick Search} for this file:
\begin{Th}{Quick Search}
    \begin{compactdesc}
        \item (2\_P1.2.1.*) Polynomial rings.
        \item (2\_P1.2.2.*) Matrix rings.
        \item (2\_P1.2.3.*) Group rings.
    \end{compactdesc}
\end{Th}

Then with everything prepared, here we go. 

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P1.2.1 (polynomial rings)}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Given a ring $R$, the set 
        $$ R[x] = \{a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n\} $$
        \textcolor{Th}{is a ring,} called the \textbf{polynomial ring} over $R$ in the indeterminate $x$ (or, the polynomial ring in variable $x$ with coefficients in $R$). The definition of the addition and multiplication of $R[x]$ are of course what follows, which we should have been familiar with.
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item (Addition) Componentwise addition.
            \item (Multiplication) Calculate by expanding out and collecting like terms.
        \end{compactenum}
        For a polynomial $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n\neq 0$ ($a_n\neq 0$), the $a_n$ is called the \textbf{leading coefficient} and $a_nx^n$ is called the \textbf{leading term}. In this case, we say that $p(x)$ is of \textbf{degree} $n$, denoted by $\deg p(x) = n$. The degree of the zero polynomial is defined to be $-\infty$. 
        \item \textcolor{Th}{For the polynomial ring $R[x]$, we have $R\subseteq R[x]$.}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The polynomial ring $R[x]$ is commutative iff the ring $R$ is.}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The polynomial ring $R[x]$ has an identity iff the ring $R$ does.}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item We have in the chapter 1 of the course 1 defined the polynomial ring over a number field $\mathbb{F}$, where we denoted the polynomial ring as $\mathcal{P}_\mathbb{F}(x)$. The polynomial ring defined here is the same as the one defined at that time (if $R$ here is a number field), but with a different notation.
        \item The statement $R\subseteq R[x]$ means that $R[x]$ contains some (ring-)isomorphic copy of $R$, which would be talked soon in this chapter.
        \item \textcolor{Th}{If $R$ is an integral domain, then for $p(x), q(x)\in R[x]$ we have:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $\deg(p(x) + q(x)) \leq \max\{\deg p(x), \deg q(x)\}$;
            \item $\deg(p(x)q(x)) = \deg p(x) + \deg q(x)$;
            \item $R[x]$ is an integral domain.
        \end{compactenum}}
        where the condition ``$R$'' is an integral domain" is necessary for the second statement, as it assures that the leading coefficient of $p(x)q(x)$ would not vanish.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P1.2.2 (matrix rings)}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Given a ring $R$, the set of all $n\times n$ matrices, denoted by $\mathcal{M}_n(R)$, is a ring under the usual matrix addition and multiplication,} called the ($n\times n$) \textbf{matrix ring} over $R$. 
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The tricks of computation using block matrix including \{course: 1, ID: 5.3\} and \{course: 1, ID: 5.3.1\} are still valid here.}
        \item Make use of the block-matrix-computation, we can easily show that \textcolor{Th}{$\mathcal{M}_n(R)$ has an identity iff $R$ does, in which case the identity of $\mathcal{M}_n(R)$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix
        $$ I_n = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & & \\
            & \ddots & \\
            & & 1
        \end{bmatrix} $$}
        and the set $(\mathcal{M}_n(R))^\times$ of units of $\mathcal{M}_n(R)$ is denoted by $GL_n(R)$, called the \textbf{general linear group} of degree $n$ over $R$.
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The matrix ring $\mathcal{M}_n(R)$ is commutative only if $R$ is a trivial ring.}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Df}{Df 2\_P1.2.3 (group rings)}
    Let $G$ be a group written multiplicatively, and $R$ be a ring. Then $R$ is of course Abelian, and by the Df \{, ID: 1\_P1.16.1\} we write the direct sum of the family $\{R_g: g\in G\}$ where $R_g = R$ for all $g\in G$, as
    $$ R(G) = \sum_{g\in G} R_g = \sum_{g\in G} R = \{(r_g)_{g\in G}: \text{ only finitely many } r_g\neq 0\}. $$
    Then write the elements $(r_g)_{g\in G}$ of $R(G)$ as the \textbf{formal sums}
    $$ (r_g)_{g\in G} = r_{g_1}g_1 + \cdots + r_{g_n}g_n = r_1g_1 + \cdots + r_ng_n = \sum_{i=1}^n r_ig_i. $$
    Here we allow that some of the $r_i$'s are zero and that some of the $g_i$'s are repeated, so that an element of $R(G)$ may be written in formally different ways. With this notation we define the addition and multiplication on $R(G)$ as
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item (Addition) Componentwise addition; 
        \item (Multiplication) Calculate by expanding out and collecting like terms.
    \end{compactenum}
    The definition of the addition and multiplication of $R(G)$ is similar to that of the polynomial ring $R[x]$ in Df \{, ID: 2\_P1.2.1\}. Then we can check that \textcolor{Th}{these definitions are well-defined, under which $R(G)$ is a ring,} called the \textbf{group ring} of $G$ over $R$.  
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Th}{For the group ring $R(G)$, 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $R\subseteq R(G)$ (that is, $R(G)$ contains a (ring-isomorphic) copy of $R$);
        \item $R(G)$ is commutative iff both $R$ and $G$ are commutative;
        \item $R(G)$ has an identity iff $R$ does, in which case the identity of $R(G)$ is the element $1_R 1_G$.
    \end{compactenum}}
    \textcolor{Df}{When the identity (of $R$, or of $G$) appears in the notation of formal sum, omit it. For example, we write $rg+1_R h = rg + h$, $rg+s1_G = rg + s$.}
\end{Rmk}

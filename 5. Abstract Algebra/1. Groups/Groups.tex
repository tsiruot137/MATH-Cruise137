\maketitle

This is the 1st chapter of Abstract Algebra, which is about the \textbf{Groups}. By the way, we now pre-claim some commonly-used notations and terms:

Then with everything prepared, here we go. 

\begin{Df}{Df1.1 (groups)}
    A \textbf{group} is a non-empty set $G$ with a binary operation $*$ (or denoted as $\times$) on it (i.e. for any $a, b\in G$, $a*b\in G$) that satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item (Associative) For any $a, b, c\in G$, $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$.
        \item (Two-sided Identity) There exists an element $1\in G$ ($1$ here is some element in $G$, not the number $1$) such that for any $a\in G$, $1*a=a*1=a$. \textcolor{Th}{Obviously, such $1$ is unique, } and we call it the \textbf{identity element} (or \textbf{identity} for short) of $G$.
        \item (Two-sided Inverse) For any $a\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $a*a^{-1}=a^{-1}*a=1$. \textcolor{Th}{Obviously, for any $a\in G$, such $a^{-1}$ is unique, } and we call it the \textbf{inverse element} (or \textbf{inverse} for short) of $a$. 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Df}{The identity element of a group is also denoted as $e$ or $\mathrm{id}$ in some cases, as long as it is clear from the context.}
        \item \textcolor{Df}{A non-empty set $G$ with a binary operation $*$ (write as a tuple $(G, \ast)$) that satisfies the first property (resp. the first two properties) (resp. all the three properties) is called a \textbf{semigroup} (resp. a \textbf{monoid}) (resp. a \textbf{group}).}
        \item \textcolor{Df}{For the binary operation $*$ on $G$, we interpret it as ``multiplication'' and write $a*b$ as $a\cdot b$ or $ab$. This is called the \textbf{multiplicative notation}. There is also the \textbf{additive notation}, which is often used for Abelian groups (talked about later).}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{A single element itself can be defined as a group}, \textcolor{Df}{called the \textbf{trivial group}. In this case, the group is said to be trivial.}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Obviously, for a group $G$ we have
        \begin{compactenum}

            \item Define $a_1a_2a_3\cdots a_n = (\cdots ((a_1a_2)a_3)\cdots a_{n-1})a_n$. Then the associative parentheses can be arbitrarily placed in $a_1\cdots a_n$ without changing the result.
            \item (Two-sided cancellation) For any $a, b, c\in G$, if $c*a=c*b$, (resp. $a*c=b*c$), then $a=b$.
        \end{compactenum}}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Some examples of groups include:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$, $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, $(\mathbb{C}, +)$, each with the identity $0$ and the inverse $-a$;
            \item $(\mathbb{Q}\backslash\{0\}, \cdot)$, $(\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\}, \cdot)$, $(\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}, \cdot)$, each with the identity $1$ and the inverse $1/a$;
            \item $(\mathbb{F}^n, +)$, $(\mathbb{F}^{m,n}, +)$ where $\mathbb{F}$ is a number field, each with the identity $\mathbf{0}$ (the zero vector or matrix) and the inverse $-\mathbf{a}$;
            \item $(A(S), \circ)$ where $S$ is a non-empty set and $A(S)$ is the set of all bijections $f$ from $S$ to $S$, with the identity $\text{id}_S$ (the identity function) and the inverse $f^{-1}$.
        \end{compactenum}}
        \textcolor{Df}{For the group $A(S)$ here, the elements in $A(S)$ are called \textbf{permutations} of $S$. If $S = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, then $A(S)$ called the \textbf{symmetric group on $n$ letters}, denoted by $\mathbb{S}_n$.} \textcolor{Df}{For $f\in\mathbb{S}_n$ and $a\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$, we call $a$ a \textbf{fixed point} (resp. \textbf{non-fixed point}) of $f$ if $f(a) = a$ (resp. $f(a) \neq a$).}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Df}{Df1.2 (order)}
    Let $G$ be a group ($(G, \ast)$). Then:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item The \textbf{order} of an element $a\in G$, denoted as $|a|$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n=1$ (here $a^n = \underbrace{a\ast a\ast \cdots \ast a}_{n\text{ times}}$). If no such $n$ exists, then we say that the order of $a$ is infinite, denoted as $|a|=\infty$;
        \item The \textbf{order} of a group $G$ is the Cardinality of $G$, denoted as $|G|$. $G$ is said to be \textbf{finite} (resp. \textbf{infinite}) if $G$ is a finite (resp. infinite) set.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Df}{Define the \textbf{integer powers} of an element $a$ in a group $G$ as $a^0\triangleq 1$, $a^1\triangleq a$, $a^2\triangleq a\ast a$, $a^3\triangleq a\ast a\ast a$, $\cdots$, and $a^{-1}\triangleq a^{-1}$, $a^{-2}\triangleq (a^{-1})^2 = (a^2)^{-1}$, $a^{-3}\triangleq (a^{-1})^3 = (a^3)^{-1}$, $\cdots$.}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th1.2.1}
    Finite groups' elements all have finite orders.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: If otherwise some element $a$ in the finite group $G$ has infinite order, namely, the sequence $a, a^2, a^3, \cdots$ would not go back to $1$, then it must have a repeated element (since $G$ contains only finitely many elements), say, $a^i=a^{i+k}$ for some $i, k>0$. Then $a^k = 1$, contradiction.
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df1.3 (Abelian group)}
    A group $G$ is said to be \textbf{Abelian} or \textbf{commutative} if the binary operation is commutative, i.e. 
    $$ ab = ba $$
    for any $a, b\in G$.
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The group $(\mathbb{S}_n, \circ)$ is not Abelian for $n\geq 3$.}
        \item \textcolor{Df}{We often use the additive notation for Abelian groups, that is, we denote the binary operation as $+$ and write $a+b$ instead of $a\ast b$. Hence, for general groups, we use the multiplicative notation, and denote the identity as $1$ and the inverse as $a^{-1}$; for Abelian groups, we use the additive notation, and denote the identity as $0$ and the inverse as $-a$.}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Ex1.3.1}
    Let $G$ be a group. Prove that:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $a^2=1$ for any $a\in G$, then $G$ is Abelian.
        \item If $|G|$ is finite and even, then there exists $a\in G$ such that $a\neq 1$ and $a^2=1$.
        \item For elements $a, b\in G$, we have $|a^{-1}| = |a|$, $|ab| = |ba|$ and $|bab^{-1}| = |a|$.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Since $a^2=1$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $a=a^{-1}$, we have
        $$ ab = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba. $$
        \item Pair the non-desired elements $a$ with their inverses $a^{-1}$, and remove all these ``bad'' pairs $(a, a^{-1})$ from $G$.
        \item Obvious. 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Ex1.4 (dihedral group)}
    Let $P_n$ be the regular $n$-gon in the $\mathbb{R}^2$ plane ($n\geq 3$) whose center is placed at the origin. Consider the set $\mathbb{D}_n$ of all the linear isometries $S$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that keep $P_n$ invariant (i.e. $S(P_n)=P_n$). Then
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Is $\mathbb{D}_n$ a group?
        \item Which elements are in $\mathbb{D}_n$? 
        \item What are the orders of the group and the elements?
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $(\mathbb{D}_n, \circ)$ is a group, \textcolor{Df}{called the \textbf{dihedral group}}. This can be answered after we figure out the elements in $\mathbb{D}_n$ (see below).
        \item The discussion about determinants (in the I1 file of the chapter 8, course 1) gives us the very hint about the answer, which is that $\mathbb{D}_n$ contains and only contains $n$ rotation operators and $n$ flipping operators, $2n$ elements in total. Actually, let $r$ be the rotation operator that rotates the regular $n$-gon by $2\pi/n$ counterclockwise, and let $s$ be the flipping operator that flips the $n$-gon with respect to the axis passing through the vertex $1$ (let us mark the vertices of the $n$-gon as $1, 2, \cdots, n$ beforehand) and the center. Then we know that these $2n$ elements 
        $$ r^0, r, \cdots, r^{n-1}, s, sr, \cdots, sr^{n-1} $$
        are all in $\mathbb{D}_n$, and it seems that $r^0 = r^n = s^2 = s^0 = \mathrm{id}$ for $\mathbb{D}_n$ to be a group. Then we can easily check that this set (with these $2n$ elements) is a group. Besides, $\mathbb{D}_n$ only contains these $2n$ elements. Actually, since a linear isometry preserves the norms of vectors, a vertex of the $n$-gon can only be mapped to again a vertex; and since an isometry also preserves the distances between points, two adjacent vertices of the $n$-gon can only be mapped to again two adjacent vertices. Hence an element in $\mathbb{D}_n$ is determined by which vertices it maps the vertices $1$ and $2$ to, and there are exactly $2n$ such possibilities. Thus $|\mathbb{D}_n|=2n$ and there is no other element except for these $2n$ elements in $\mathbb{D}_n$.
        \item From 2, we know that $|D_n|=2n$, and
        $$ |r^k| = \frac{\lcm(k, n)}{k}, \quad |sr^k| = 2 $$
        for any $k=1,\cdots, n$ (where $\lcm$ is the least common multiple).
        Actually, $|r^k|$ is obvious, and we can verify that $|s| = 2$ and $sr = r^{-1}s$, so that 
        $$ sr^k sr^k = sr^{k-1}r(sr)r^{k-1} = sr^{k-1}r(r^{-1}s)r^{k-1} = sr^{k-1}sr^{k-1} = \cdots = ss = \mathrm{id}. $$
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Df}{Df1.5 (cycle)}
    A permutation $\sigma\in\mathbb{S}_n$ (of course $n\geq 2$) is called a \textbf{cycle} in $\mathbb{S}_n$ if there exist distinct $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m\in \{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ ($m\geq 2$) such that
    $$ \sigma(a_1) = a_2, \quad \sigma(a_2) = a_3, \quad \cdots \quad ,\sigma(a_{m-1}) = a_m, \quad \sigma(a_m) = a_1 $$
    and $\sigma(a_i) = a_i$ for any $a_i\notin \{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m\}$. In this case:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item We write $\sigma = \cycl (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$ (or $\sigma = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$, or $\sigma = (a_1a_2\cdots a_m)$, if no ambiguity), and call $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$ a \textbf{cycle expression} of $\sigma$, and call $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m$ the \textbf{elements} of $\sigma$;
        \item \textcolor{Th}{The non-fixed points of $\sigma$ are exactly the elements of $\sigma$, and the fixed points of $\sigma$ are exactly the others.} Thus \textcolor{Th}{the elements of $\sigma$ are unique (that is, must be the set of non-fixed points of $\sigma$)}, and we call $m$ the \textbf{length} of $\sigma$, or say that $\sigma$ is a $m$-cycle.
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Obviously there is no $1$-cycle. And the $0$-cycle is exactly the identity map.}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Different expressions of the same cycle is of cyclic symmetry, that is, all possible expressions of the cycle $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$ are exactly $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$, $(a_2, \cdots, a_m, a_1)$, $\cdots$, $(a_m, a_1, a_2, \cdots )$.}
        \item $\sigma$ is called a \textbf{transposition} if $m=2$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Th}{Not all permutations are cycles.} For example, the permutation $f\in\mathbb{S}_4$ such that $f(1,2,3,4) = (3,4,1,2)$ is not a cycle. Actually, if otherwise $f$ is a cycle, then we write down $f$ beginning with $1$:
        $$ f = \left(1, \right. = \left(1, 3, \right. = \left(1, 3\right) $$
        which means that $f(2) = 2$ and $f(4) = 4$, contradiction.
        \item \textcolor{Th}{(The inverse of a cycle) In $\mathbb{S}_n$, the inverse of a cycle is still a cycle:
        $$ (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)^{-1} = (a_m, \cdots, a_2, a_1). $$}
        \item (The order of cycles) \textcolor{Th}{The order of a cycle is equal to its length (expect for the $0$-cycle, whose order is $1$).} 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Th}{Th1.5.1 (disjoint permutations are commutative)}
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item \textcolor{Df}{A list of permutations $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \cdots, \sigma_m\in\mathbb{S}_n$ are said to be \textbf{disjoint} if the sets $N_1, N_2, \cdots, N_m$ of their non-fixed points are pairwise disjoint.} 
        \item Disjoint permutations are commutative.
    \end{compactenum}
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious. 
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Th1.5.2 (the cycle-decomposition of a permutation)}
    Any $f\in\mathbb{S}_n\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ (that is, $f$ is a permutation in $\mathbb{S}_n$ and $f$ is not the identity map) can be written as a product of disjoint cycles in $\mathbb{S}_n$, and this product is unique up to the order of the cycles (of course, the identity map is omitted in this product expression). 
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item (Existence) Easy to check that the following algorithm works and finds a cycle decomposition of any $f$ as desired:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item[(1)] Initially, mark all the elements $1, \cdots, n$ as unvisited.
            \item[(2)] Choose the smallest unvisited number $a$ and compute to obtain the cycle $\sigma = (a, f(a), f^2(a), \cdots)$. Use $\sigma$ as a factor in the cycle decomposition.
            \item[(3)] Mark all the elements in $\sigma$ as visited. If there is still unvisited elements, go back to step (2); otherwise, terminate.
        \end{compactenum}
        Obviously, the step (2) will end up with a cycle $\sigma$ since the $|a|$ is finite, and the next $\sigma$ obtained from the next step (2) will be disjoint with the previous ones.
        \item (Uniqueness) Suppose 
        $$ (\quad)\cdots(\quad) = [\quad]\cdots[\quad] $$
        where ``$(\quad)$'' and ``$[\quad]$'' are all cycles, and these ``$(\quad)$'' (resp. these ``$[\quad]$'') are disjoint. Then we can compare a pair of ``$(\quad)$'' and ``$[\quad]$'' via the behavior of $f$ on a non-fixed point $a$ (i.e. $f(a)\neq a$), which resulted in that $(\cdots, a, \cdots) = [\cdots, a, \cdots]$. 
    \end{compactenum}
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Th1.5.3 (the order of a permutation)}
    The order of a permutation equals the least common multiple of the orders of its cycle factors (in the expression of cycle decomposition (Th \{, ID: 1.5.2\})). In particular, the order of the identity map $\mathrm{id}$ is $1$, namely, $|\mathrm{id}|=|\text{the } 0\text{-cycle}| = \lcm(1) = 1$.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: Obvious by the cycle decomposition.
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Th1.5.4 (the transposition-decomposition of a permutation)}
    Any $f\in\mathbb{S}_n\setminus\{\mathrm{id}\}$ can be written as a product of transpositions. This factorization is not necessarily unique, and the factors (as cycles) are not necessarily disjoint.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Pf}: One can easily prove it based on the cycle decomposition, but we here prove it in an easier and more general way. Actually we do not need to formally prove it, but just need to clarify it by an exercise. That is, for an arbitrary given permutation, say, $f = (3, 4, 2, 1)^\mathrm{T}$ (here the notation means a column vector, representing that $f(1) = 3$, $f(2) = 4$, $f(3) = 2$, $f(4) = 1$), please write it as a product of transpositions. Then it is naturally to think of:
    $$ \mathrm{id} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4
    \end{bmatrix} \xlongrightarrow[\text{place } 3\text{ to the correct position}]{\text{multiply }(1,3) \text{ on the left to}} \begin{bmatrix}
        3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \\ 4
    \end{bmatrix} \xlongrightarrow[\text{place } 4\text{ to the correct position}]{\text{multiply }(2,4) \text{ on the left to}} \begin{bmatrix}
        3 \\ 4 \\ 1 \\ 2
    \end{bmatrix} \xlongrightarrow[\text{to place } 2\text{ to }\cdots]{\text{multiply }(1,2)\, \cdots} \begin{bmatrix}
        3 \\ 2 \\ 4 \\ 1
    \end{bmatrix} = f. $$
    Thus $f = (1,2)(2,4)(1,3)$. \\
    Now we see that this expression is not unique, as also $f = (3,4)(2,3)(1,4)$. Also, a general permutation may fail to be expressed as a product of disjoint transpositions, otherwise it would violates the uniqueness of the cycle decomposition. 
\end{Th}

\begin{Th}{Th1.5.5 (quickly factorizing a cycle into transpositions)}
    For any cycle $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m)$, we have
    $$ (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_m) = (a_1, a_m)(a_1, a_{m-1})\cdots(a_1, a_3)(a_1, a_2). $$

\begin{Df}{Df1.6 (homomorphisms)}
    Let $G$ and $H$ are semigroups. Then a function $f: G\to H$ is called a \textbf{homomorphism} (from $G$ to $H$) if 
    $$ f(ab) = f(a)f(b) $$
    for any $a, b\in G$. In this case, if further:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $f$ is injective, then $f$ is called a \textbf{monomorphism}.
        \item $f$ is surjective, then $f$ is called an \textbf{epimorphism}.
        \item $f$ is bijective, then $f$ is called an \textbf{isomorphism}, denoted as $f: G\overset{\sim}{\to} H$. In this case, $G$ and $H$ are called \textbf{isomorphic}, denoted as $G\simeq H$.
        \item $H = G$, then $f$ is called an \textbf{endomorphism}.
        \item $H = G$ and $f$ is bijective, then $f$ is called an \textbf{automorphism}.
    \end{compactenum}
    The set of all endomorphisms of a group $G$ is denoted as $\text{End}(G)$.

    One can prove the first statement by first showing that $f(G)$ is a subgroup (subgroups are talked later, but here is no cyclic reasoning) of $H$, and that $f(1_G) = 1_{f(G)}$ (the identity element of the group $f(G)$), and then using the fact that $1_{f(G)} = 1_H$.

We claim that $d\mid h$, and then we complete the proof of this part (since if $d\mid h$, then $\overline{h}\in\langle\overline{d}\rangle$). Consider $\gcd(h, d)$, we first have $\gcd(h, d) \leq d$. Now write the Bezout identity:
        $$ xh + yd = \gcd(h, d), $$

We first have $\langle \overline{d^\prime}\rangle < \langle d \rangle$. For the other direction, write again the Bezout identity:

    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}: 
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item First assume that $\gcd(|a|, |b|) = 1$. Then we claim that $|ab| = |a||b| = \lcm(|a|, |b|)$. On one hand, $|ab|$ divides $|a||b|$ since 
        $$ (ab)^{|a||b|} \xlongequal{G \text{ is Abelian}} a^{|a||b|}b^{|b||a|} = 1. $$
        On the other hand, $|a||b|$ divides $|ab|$. Actually, since $(ab)^{|ab|} = 1$, we have
        $$ a^{|b||ab|} = a^{|b||ab|}b^{|b||ab|} = (ab)^{|b||ab|} = 1, $$
        and thus $|a|$ divides $|b||ab|$. By the Bezout identity $x|a| + y|b| = 1$, we have
        $$ x|a||ab| + y|b||ab| = |ab|. $$
        Since $|a|$ divides $|b||ab|$, and thus divides the left side of the identity, we obtain that $a$ divides $|ab|$. By a similar argument we have that $|b|$ divides $|ab|$. Thus $|ab|$ is a common multiple of $|a|$ and $|b|$, and thus $|a||b| = \lcm(|a|, |b|)$ divides $|ab|$.
        \item Then consider the general case $\gcd(|a|, |b|) = d$. Denote $|a| = m$, $|b| = n$. A natural idea is to reduce it to the previous case, which requires us to write 
        $$ \lcm(m,n) = m^\prime n^\prime $$
        for some $m^\prime$, $n^\prime$ s.t. $m^\prime|m$, $n^\prime|n$ and $\gcd(m^\prime, n^\prime) = 1$. This can be achieved by first performing the prime-factorization:
        $$ \begin{aligned}
            &\lcm(m,n) = \frac{m}{d}\cdot d\cdot\frac{n}{d} = p\cdot d\cdot q \\
            &= \underbrace{\prod_{i} p_i}_p \underbrace{\prod_{i} p_{k_i} \prod_{i} r_i \prod_{i} q_{k_i}}_d \underbrace{\prod_{i} q_i}_q \\
            &= \Pi_1\Pi_2\Pi_3\Pi_4\Pi_5,
        \end{aligned} $$
        where the $p_i$'s, $r_i$'s, $q_i$'s are primes, and $\{p_i\}$, $\{q_i\}$, $\{r_i\}$ are disjoint. Now let $m^\prime = \Pi_1\Pi_2\Pi_3$, $n^\prime = \Pi_4\Pi_5$, and we can easily check that $m^\prime$ and $n^\prime$ satisfy the requirements. Therefore by the previous case, we have $|a^{m/m^\prime}| = m^\prime$ and $|b^{n/n^\prime}| = n^\prime$, and thus
        $$ |a^{m/m^\prime}b^{n/n^\prime}| = m^\prime n^\prime = \lcm(m,n). $$

        and thus it suffices to show that $|H|\cdot [K:C] = |HK|$. Now consider showing this map is bijective: $f: H\times I \to HK$ defined as

For surjectivity, we affirm it by the fact that $HK = \bigcup_{k\in I} Hk$. Actually, since $K = \bigcup_{k\in I} Ck$, we can multiply $H$ on both sides to get the desired result, using the absorption and distributive properties of subsets product.

    Let $G$ be a group and $H, K< G$. Please find an isomorphism (according to what is given, that is, consider an isomorphism between two of these groups: $H$, $K$, $H\cap K$, $H\vee K$, $H/(H\cap K)$, $K/(H\cap K)$ and all others you can think of). To do this, please figure out what other conditions are needed.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}: If it is not that clear that which two groups (among all that we can think if) are isomorphic, we can first finding an equality of cardinalities, as an isomorphism is first a bijection. Then for this what comes to our mind is that
    $$ |HK|\cdot |H\cap K|= |H|\cdot |K|. $$
    As we now know little about the Cartisian product of groups, we consider dividing the two sides of the equality instead, by
    $$ \frac{|HK|}{|H|} = \frac{|K|}{|H\cap K|}, $$
    and interpreting the division of cardinalities as the cardinality of the quotient group. Then it is a problem that $HK$ is not a subgroup. Of course this can be solved by assuming that one of $H$ and $K$ is normal in $G$. Then by the Th \{, ID: 1.11.2\}, we should let \textcolor{P}{$N\nles G$} instead of $K\nles G$, so that the problem becomes comes to that to find a homomorphism between two quotient groups, which inspires us to apply the Clry \{, ID: 1.12.4\} by considering $f: K\to NK$ as

    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}: To generalize this equality is to ask whether the equality
    $$ (G/K)\Big/ (H/K) \simeq (G/H) $$
    hold, provided that \textcolor{P}{$K\nles G$, $H\nles G$ and $K\nles H$}. Now is it true that $(H/K)\nles (G/K)$? Obviously yes, and then we know our ways, which is to apply the Clry \{, ID: 1.12.4\}, by considering the following commutative diagram:
    $$ \begin{tikzcd}

    \end{compactenum}
    To answer these questions, figure out what other conditions are needed.
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Obviously $M\nles H$ implies $f^{-1}(M) \nles G$. For the former, $f(N)\nles H$, it suffices to that $f$ is an epimorphism.
        \item Now we study the map $\varphi$.
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item For the range of $\varphi$, we first ask whether $\varphi$ is surjective. Then for $L<H$, is there any $K<G$ s.t. $f(K) = L$? For this to be true, we are first worried about that $f$ is not epimorphic, which would result in that some $L$ beyond the $f(G)$ may fail to have a pre-image. Thus we assume that \textcolor{P}{$f$ is an epimorphism}. Then with this new assumption, $\varphi$ is surjective, since $L = f(f^{-1}(L)) = \varphi(f^{-1}(L))$ given $L<H$.
            \item Is $\varphi$ injective? Does $f(K_1) = f(K_2)$ imply $K_1 = K_2$? This is not so clear, but we notice that $f(K) = f(f^{-1}(f(K)))$, which maybe fail to imply $K = f^{-1}(f(K))$. Actually, the injectivity of $\varphi$ is equivalent to the fact that $K = f^{-1}(f(K))$ holds for every $K < G$. Now we inspect this condition. Clearly $K<f^{-1}(f(K))$. For the other direction, we can easily obtain a sufficient, but extra condition: \textcolor{P}{$\Ker f<K$}. Thus consider restricting $\varphi$ on the set $\mathrm{S}_f(G)\triangleq \{K<G: \,\Ker f<K\}$ we get an injection. 
            \item $\varphi$ is surjective, but how about the restriction of $\varphi$ on $\mathrm{S}_f(G)$? Does the surjectivity of $f$ still imply the surjectivity of (the restricted) $\varphi$? Yes, if $f$ is an epimorphism, then we can still have $L = f(f^{-1}(L)) = \varphi(f^{-1}(L))$ for $L<H$, since always $\Ker f<f^{-1}(L)$.

\begin{Df}{Df1.13.1 (the parity of a permutation)}
    In $\mathbb{S}_n$ ($n\geq 2$), an \textbf{odd permutation} (resp. \textbf{even permutation}) is a permutation that can be expressed as a product of an odd (resp. even) number of transpositions. 
\end{Df}

\begin{Rmk}{}
    \textcolor{Th}{This definition is well-defined, that is, any permutation cannot be both odd and even.} Actually, this fact was discussed in the 8th chapter of the course 1, where we discussed the parity of a permutation before defining the determinants of square matrices. Then one can be clear that the concept of ``permutation'' is just the same as the one discussed there, and we had an analogue to ``transposition'' there, which is the ``swap'' defined in the Df \{course: 1, ID: 8.1.-1.1\}. Strictly a transposition is not a swap. A transposition exchanges the assigned elements, while a swap exchanges the assigned positions. But these two concepts correspond to each other:
    $$ S(\pmb{p}) = (p, q) \pmb{p} $$
    where $\pmb{p}$ is a permutation, $(p,q)$ is a transposition and $S$ is the swap operator. For $S$ and $(p,q)$ in this equality, if one is $\forall$, then the other is $\exists$. \\
    Therefore things become easy. By those blocks \{course: 1, ID: 8.1.-1.*\}, a permutation is odd (resp. even) $\Longleftrightarrow$ the permutation is a product of an odd (resp. even) number of transpositions $\Longleftrightarrow$ the number of reversals of the permutation is odd (resp. even). As the number of reversals cannot be both odd and even, so does the parity of a permutation.

Then what?
    \tcblower
    \textit{Solution}: An Abelian group $G$ is simple iff it has no proper subgroup. However, we have a easiest way to contruct a, in most of the case, proper subgroup of $G$, that is, $\langle a\rangle < G$. Thus to make $G$ simple, we must let it to be cyclic. Then, $G\simeq\mathbb{Z}$ or $G\simeq\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. Since the former case is also impossible (for $G$ to be simple), $G$ must be (isomorphic to) $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. Since the subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ are exactly those $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ with $k\mid m$, we get the answer.
